Minecraft proxy server for Hypixel. It's like a stats overlay, but better. This program will be integrated in Solar Tweaks V4. For now you can build it by yourself and enhoy it before a release. And ss a lot of our projects, this one is also open source!

**‚ö†Ô∏è But this version may have bugs!**

# Downloading ‚¨áÔ∏è
For now you must [build it yourself](#building-from-source-%EF%B8%8F).

# Usage ‚öíÔ∏è

To use it you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. *(LTS version is recommended)*

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
At the root of the project create a `config.json` file with the following content: *(You can also find the content of this file in the `config.example.jsonc` file)*
```json5
{
  "api_key": "", // Your Hypixel API key (`/api` in game)
  "dodge": {
    "enabled": true, // Whether or not to use auto dodge
    // (If false you will still be able to use the '/dodge' command)
    // Dodge when:
    "nicked": true, // Player is nicked
    "winStreak": 10, // Player has a winstreak of 10 or more
    "bestWinStreak": 25, // Player's best winstreak is 25 or more
    "sendStats": false // Send stats even if the game has been dodged
  }
}
```
